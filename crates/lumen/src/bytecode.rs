//! Bytecode tier v0: a per-function stack VM behind the tree-walking interpreter.
//!
//! The tree-walker is the reference oracle — it passes 100% of test262 and its semantics are
//! never altered by this tier. A function is either compiled *whole* (its body contains only
//! constructs this compiler fully understands) or it runs in the tree-walker; there is no partial
//! compilation and no deoptimization. Every operation with observable semantics (property access,
//! calls, coercions, name resolution outside the function) delegates to the interpreter's own
//! helpers, so behavior differences can only come from the local-variable and dispatch layers.
//!
//! Locals live in a flat slot vector: v0 refuses any function where a local could be observed
//! from outside (inner functions/closures, direct `eval`, `with`, `arguments`, destructuring),
//! which is what makes slot storage sound. TDZ is represented by `Value::Empty` in the slot —
//! reads check it and throw the same ReferenceError the tree-walker would.
//!
//! Tier selection (see `Interp::tier`): `interp` (default — this module is never entered),
//! `bytecode` (compile at `tier_threshold` calls; 0 = immediately). Selectable via the `LUMEN_TIER`
//! / `LUMEN_TIER_THRESHOLD` env vars, the CLI's `--tier`, or `Engine::set_tier`.
